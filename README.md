# Predicting-heart-attack-risk-based-on-gene-expression
Machine learning exercises for predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on a person's gene expression.

In this project, we received gene expression data for individuals who have experienced a heart attack and those who have not. Our task was to build models to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on this data. The detailed explanation can be found in the description file.
